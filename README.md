#### HyperScheduler

##### TODO (update this doc with your name next to an item if you plan on implementing it, strikethrough each item when implemented):

- homepage rework (the user should land on a login page instead of the homepage itself. From the new homepage, the user can navigate to the content that they need to interact with
- setup firebase and personalized view of the site
- update the nav bar: when signed in, show the user signed in and perhaps a notifications button as well
- notifications: send a user a notification when a new availability sheet comes out, when the schedule is changed involving them, etc.
- calendar: this should replace the view schedule page. In calendar view, users can see a month-long calendar that shows the the visits for each day. Users can filter the calendar to show only when they're working.
- find subs should guide the user through the sub finding process: first, ask the user what day they are looking for a sub for, then what time. We can the query the database for who is available when and then report the contact info back to the user. We can optionally include a "ask in Slack" button that prints an automatically generated message to the coverage channel. 
- contact: this is pretty simple, just a list of pertinent names and numbers.
